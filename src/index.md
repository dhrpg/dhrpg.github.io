The DH RPG is a tabletop role-playing game designed to teach project management and ethical collaboration in the context of digital humanities projects.

The DH RPG was created by [Quinn Dombrowski](http://www.quinndombrowski.com), who taught it as part of [DLCL 205](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl205) at Stanford University in winter 2020.

You can read more about the RPG and the course in:

* "Academia is a Dice Roll", with Agnieszka Backman, Sabrina Grimberg, and Melissa Hosek, forthcoming in *Debates in DH: The Digital Futures of Graduate Study in the Humanities*, eds. Simon Appleford, Gabriel Hankins, and Anouk Lang.
