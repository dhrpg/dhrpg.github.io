Thanks to John Ayliff , Katia Bowers, James Cummings, Karin Dalziel, Jessica Dusasult, Rikk Mulligan, and Alex Wermer-Colan for their feedback on the first draft of the DH RPG.

Thanks to Mark Algee-Hewitt, Amanda Wilson Bergado, Melissa Hosek, and Camille Villa for their intrepid play-testing of the DH RPG.

The DH RPG is directly adapted from the 1980's and 1990's original [Star Wars D6 RPG by West End Games](http://www.starwarstimeline.net/Westendgames.htm). This whole project never would have happened were it not for my childhood best friend and co-adventurer Ali Lane, and her (in retrospect) incredibly patient and generous game master older brother, Sam Lane.
