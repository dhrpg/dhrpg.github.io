## Character types

Every character has a *character type*, which determines how many skill points you can assign to the character at the beginning of the game, and how quickly they level up.

Different localizations of the DH RPG should have different character types; these are based on academic and institutional positions and ranks in the United States, with a focus on research universities.


### Undergrads
Undergrads have 8D of assignable dice to use for character customization.

The default levels for undergrad skill areas are as follows:

* 1D in Disciplinary (max 4D)
* 1D in Technical
* 1D in Management
* 1D in Interpersonal
* 2D in Personal

If undergrads work with non-English languages (and don't have a family or community background with the language), chances are they’re still learning. Treating 5D as fluent, choose a level of fluency for the character corresponding to how much they’ve studied and traveled, and the difficulty of the language.

### Grad Students
Grad students have 10D of assignable dice to use for character customization.

The default levels for grad student skill areas are as follows:

* 3D in Disciplinary (max 5D)
* 1D in Technical
* 1D in Management (max 4D)
* 2D in Interpersonal
* 2D in Personal

If grad students work with non-English languages, you can choose their level of fluency with the language, based on their past experiences. Treat 5D as fluent. (If they’ve just taken courses but never spent much time in-country, particularly for a "difficult" language, they should have a maximum of 3D in the language.)

### Early-Career Staff
Early-career staff (e.g. librarians and technical staff with &lt;5 years experience, who may be recent graduates of library school programs, coding bootcamps, and/or recent PhDs on alt-ac career paths) have 7D of assignable dice to use for character customization.

* 7D to be split between Disciplinary and Technical (at least 2D in the non-dominant skill area)
* 2D in Management
* 3D in Interpersonal
* 2D in Personal


### Postdocs and Early-Career Faculty
Postdocs and assistant professors have 7D of assignable dice to use for character customization.

* 5D in Disciplinary
* 2D in Technical
* 3D in Management
* 4D in Interpersonal
* 1D in Personal

If an early-career scholar works with non-English languages, they are fluent in those languages by default, and don’t have to roll dice to work in that language. (An exception may be a language in an inaccessible country -- e.g. Albania during the Cold War -- where they might have a fluent reading knowledge but struggle with speaking/listening. Treat 5D as fluent, and assign a lower dice number to the language accordingly.)

### Mid-Career Staff
Mid-career librarians and staff (with 5-15 years experience on their career path) have 6D of assignable dice to use for character customization.

* 11D to split between Disciplinary, Technical, and Management (at least 2D in the non-dominant skill areas)
* 4D in Interpersonal
* 3D in Personal


### Mid-Career Faculty
Associate professors have 6D of assignable dice to use for character customization.

* 6D in Disciplinary
* 2D in Technical
* 4D in Management
* 4D in Interpersonal
* 1D in Personal

If a mid-career scholar works with non-English languages, they are fluent in those languages by default, and don’t have to roll dice to work in that language. (An exception may be a language in an inaccessible country -- e.g. Albania during the Cold War -- where they might have a fluent reading knowledge but struggle with speaking/listening. Treat 5D as fluent, and assign a lower dice number to the language accordingly.)

### Executive Staff
"Executive" level librarians and staff (CIOs, CTOs, ULs, AULs, etc.) have 5D of assignable dice to use for character customization. 

The default levels for the senior faculty skill areas are as follows:

* 9D to split between Disciplinary and Technical, or add to Management
* 4D in Management
* 4D in Interpersonal
* 4D in Personal


### Senior Faculty
Senior faculty (who have been tenured for some time, and may be named chairs) have 7D of assignable dice to use for character customization. 

The default levels for the senior faculty skill areas are as follows:

* 7D in Disciplinary
* 1D in Technical
* 5D in Management
* 3D in Interpersonal
* 2D in Personal

If a senior scholar works with non-English languages, they are fluent in those languages by default, and don’t have to roll dice to work in that language. (An exception may be a language in an inaccessible country -- e.g. Albania during the Cold War -- where they might have a fluent reading knowledge but struggle with speaking/listening. Treat 5D as fluent, and assign a lower dice number to the language accordingly.)
