## Character Stories

Who is your character? What motivates them? Who do they care about? Your character is more than a collection of skill levels: your task is to make them a believable person. 

Any description of a person is a snapshot in time, and 2020 was a very long year. You should describe your character as they were on **February 1, 2020**. We'll talk through the changes you'll need to make to your character sheet over the course of the year (starting with March 2020, when our game begins), but don't create your character as you find them in the midst of an unfolding crisis. Create them as they were in the last days of the "before-times", whatever that looked like for them.

You can write as much as you'd like about your character's background, but respond at least briefly to each of the following prompts.

### Name
First and last name(s), along with any nicknames they commonly use

### Usual social media username
If they use TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media, what's their usual username? Or what's their personal email address? (e.g. *sparklyunicorn81*)

### Age
How old are they? If they claim to be older / younger than they actually are, how old do they claim to be?

### Gender & pronouns
All gender and pronouns (or lack thereof) are welcome!

### Academic / disciplinary background
What academic field(s) are the character's degrees (if any) in? Do they have any particularly significant other training or qualifications (e.g. professional degrees, certifications, etc.)

### Early bird or night owl?
Does the character prefer mornings or nights?

### Living situation
Who (if anyone) does the character live with? How much private space (if any) do they have at home? How is their relationship with other people who share their living space?

### Important relationships
Who are the people the character cares about most, whether or not they live with those people? (e.g. a character might have a close relationship with a grandfather or aunt, or a group of long-term friends.) Where (what country/city) do those important people live, and is there anything noteworthy about *their* living situations (e.g. nursing home)?

### What makes them happy?
When your character is the happiest, what are they doing?

### 2020 New Year's Resolution
What was your character's New Year's Resolution on January 1, 2020. (Or if they're not the type to make New Year's Resolutions, what is one thing they wanted to do better/differently in 2020?)

### Biggest worry (as of February 1, 2020)
What was weighing on your character's mind as of February 1, 2020? (Keep in mind that this is before the US declared COVID-19 a public health emergency or restricted air travel from China.)

### What are they looking forward to?
Whether it's a spring break trip, summer vacation, a favorite conference, or the next season of their favorite streaming show, what is your character looking forward to in the near future?
